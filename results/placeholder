In Damascus, there's a famous ice cream parlor called Bakdesh, which makes emaa' - traditional 
Syrian ice cream. I've never actually been to that parlor, but I've had emaa' before. Its a
fantastic dessert, very rich, that I firmly believe everyone should try if you like ice cream.
Unfortunately, nobody here in the USA seems to know how to make it, and I haven't been able to
go back since 2009. If anyone knows of a good emaa' place, let me know please.
