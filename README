  Overview
+------------------------------------------------------------+

  ASAL is a pipeline for functional analysis of metagenomics data, designed to be as simple
  and user-friendly as possible. It stands for "A Simple, Automated pipeLine", and also takes its name 
  from the Arabic word for honey (alternatively, Another Stupid Automated pipeLine). I hope that
  you, the user, find it to indeed be sweet in its use!

  Installation
+------------------------------------------------------------+

  There are two ways to install ASAL, one being downloading and unzipping the tarball located under
  "releases", the other is directly copying this source code to your local directory via the git 
  function. For the first version, all you need to do is unwrap the tarball. For this version, however,
  you're going to need to download the HMMer and FragGeneScan releases first.
  
  To do this, fetch the HMMer (http://hmmer.org/download.html) and FragGeneScan 
  (http://omics.informatics.indiana.edu/FragGeneScan/) tarballs at their respective websites, and download 
  them to the directory where this readme is located. *DO NOT UNZIP OR UNTAR THEM*
  
  Regardless of which version you used, the next step is to run the "installer" script. All you need to 
  do is type as follows:
  
  	./installer
  
  Just like that, it will handle all of the installation, making, etc. by itself, so sit back
  and relax while it runs. Once its done running, the ASAL pipeline will be ready for use.

  Running the Pipeline
+------------------------------------------------------------+

  ASAL can take both paired-end and single-end files, in both FASTA and FASTQ format. 
  
  To run single-end data:

  	./asal -s <input file path> -o <output name>

  To run paired-end data:

  	./asal -1 <forward/first file path> -2 <reverse/second file path> -o <output file name>

  Once executed, the pipeline will automatically run until completion, updating you as steps are 
  completed, and alerting you if any errors occur.

  Output
+------------------------------------------------------------+

  ASAL outputs an individual directory for each run based on the given output file name, located
  under the "results" directory to keep everything in one place. Three files are output, a HMMer
  tabular file with the functional annotation results, a "summary.wb" file with a more easily
  readable file summarizing the results, and an "all.wb" file listing all predicted domains
  by frequency. Output from read assembly and gene prediction can also be accesed, in their respective
  sub-directories inside this main directory.

  Arguments Reference
+------------------------------------------------------------+

  -o <name> - Argument for the name of the central output directory, and the results file names.
  -s <filename> - Input for SINGLE-END files.
  -1 <filename> - Input for the first/forward PARIED-END file.
  -2 <filename> - Input for the second/reverse PAIRED-END file.
